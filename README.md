# PBE
Nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann solver for a nanoparticle interaction with membrane and solution.
Start by extracting eigen.rar to get eigen folder.
Then follow the next commands to run on linux.
chmod u+x compile
./compile
chmod u+x myprog
./myprog
myprog will run with PBEparameters.dat as input file.
Then you will get the outputs data files and plots in folder datafiles with energy outputs beside myprog and PBEparameters.dat
For other runs copy myprog and PBEparameters.dat to a new folder and change parameters as wanted and run again.
